# magic number

This is a repo for the bizzzzuu game

## Specification of the game
prompt the user for input
- input = number
- output = you have chosen said number

generate a random number using a python library (should be between 1-10)
- input = random number generator
- output = the random number

check the the number against a magic number and let the user know if they won or lost
- input = number = magic number 
- output = 'You won' or 'You lost'

if the guess was above or under
- input = number < magic number or number > magic number
- output = 'You guessed too high' or 'You guessed too low'

Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'No more Magic'
- input = guess again
- output = 'No more Magic'
